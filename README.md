# WomenAffairsPrediction-HerokuDeployment

This repository is focused on creating a model which predicts the affairs of women and classify them into category based on the independent features provided. The dataset describes the label as multiclass classification and so Logistic regression based Supervised Machine learning algorithm is used. The model is further save using pickle library and named as model2.pkl.Next step is to create a model to a web page using Flask micro web framework. Lastly but not the least, the web model need to be deployed on to the Heroku server in order to productionize the product and further can be accessed from any where . 

Below is the deployable link for your reference:
